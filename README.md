# Collabtube chrome extension
Once installed, this chrome extension allows users to attach their youtube player to a "session". Then any person that visits the https://collabtube.herokuapp.com will be able to queue the videos that will be played next in that given session.

## TODO
* Garbage collect empty sessions ?
* Add ability to remove item from the queue
* get fullscreen working consistently
* add ability to "attach/dettach" a youtube tab to the session?
* Create settings page containing:
  - Toggle auto fullscreen
  - override websocket endpoint
* show now playing video ?
